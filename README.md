# rlox

An implementation of a Lox interpreter.

## Overview

Lox is a language designed by Robert Nystrom for his entertaining book (Crafting Interpreters)[https://craftinginterpreters.com/].

This Rust-based Lox interpreter is currently a simple tree-walking interpreter. In the probably non-existent chance you work at a Lox shop, don't use this interpreter in production!
